# KAT-ViT: Vision Transformer with GRKAN Architecture

This repository implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) variant that incorporates the Group Rational Kernel Attention Network (GRKAN) architecture. The implementation combines the hierarchical structure of Vision Transformers with rational attention mechanisms for improved image classification.

## Technical Background and Architecture Details

### The Problem: Attention Mechanism Limitations

Traditional KAN face several key challenges:

1. **Inefficient Base Functions**: A B-spline is the joint of polynomaial curves at a knot. The smoothness of this joint is determined by the degree of the polynomials. Hence, because this requires an amount of recursion, it bloats the GPU making it slow.

2. **Scalability Issues**: Because of B-splines it requires unique activation functions for each input-output pair lead to excessive parameters and computations, thus, accumulating too much computational memory.

3. **Poor Initialization**: Weight initialization strategies for KANs fail to preserve variance, resulting in unstable training.

### The Solution: Kernel Attention Transformer (KAT)

KAT addresses these limitations through several key innovations:

#### 1. Group Rational Kernel Attention Network (GRKAN)

Grouped Rational KAN involves creating groups of input channels and sharing a rational basis function across all the groups.:

```math
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V

```

is replaced with:

```math
GRKAN(X) = \sum_{i=1}^G R_i(\frac{X_i}{G})
```

where:
- G is the number of groups
- R_i is a learnable rational function for group i
- X_i is the input tensor split into G groups

#### 2. Rational Function Approximation
This is the ratio of 2 polynomials of different degrees. This techniques eases the GPU on computations.
Each rational function R_i is defined as:

```math
R_i(x) = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^m a_{ij}x^j}{1 + |\sum_{k=1}^n b_{ik}x^k|}
```

where:
- m, n are the orders of numerator and denominator polynomials
- a_{ij}, b_{ik} are learnable parameters
- The denominator is guaranteed positive through the absolute value operation

#### 3. Variance preserving initialization
The Rational function coefficients are initialized to the corresponding activation function of the outputs.

### Mathematical Foundations

#### 1. Group-wise Processing

The input tensor X ∈ ℝ^(B×N×D) is split into G groups:

```math
X_i ∈ ℝ^(B×N×(D/G)), i ∈ [1,G]
```

This allows for:
- Parallel processing of different feature subspaces
- Reduced computational complexity
- Specialized attention patterns per group

#### 2. Rational Attention Mechanism

The rational attention mechanism provides several advantages:

1. **Universal Approximation**: Rational functions can approximate any continuous function on a compact domain with arbitrary precision.

2. **Efficient Computation**: The polynomial operations can be implemented efficiently using Horner's method:

```math
P(x) = a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + ... + x(a_n)))
```

3. **Stability**: The denominator's absolute value ensures numerical stability:

```math
Q(x) = 1 + |\sum_{k=1}^n b_k x^k|
```

### Architecture Implementation

#### 1. GRKAN Layer

```python
class GRKAN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, groups, rational_order, config):
        self.groups = groups
        self.group_dim = config.n_emb // groups
        self.rational_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            RationalFunction(*rational_order) 
            for _ in range(groups)
        ])
```

#### 2. Rational Function Implementation

```python
class RationalFunction(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, m, n):
        # m: numerator order
        # n: denominator order
        self.a = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(m+1))  # numerator coefficients
        self.b = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(n+1))  # denominator coefficients
```

### Computational Complexity Analysis

1. **Standard Attention**:
   - Time complexity: O(N²D)
   - Space complexity: O(N²)

2. **GRKAN**:
   - Time complexity: O(NGD)
   - Space complexity: O(ND)

where:
- N: sequence length
- D: embedding dimension
- G: number of groups

### Benefits and Improvements

1. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Reduced complexity from O(N²) to O(N)
   - Parallel processing through grouping
   - Memory-efficient attention computation

2. **Modeling Capability**:
   - Adaptive attention patterns through rational functions
   - Non-linear relationship modeling
   - Group-specific feature processing

3. **Training Stability**:
   - Guaranteed positive denominators
   - Bounded rational functions
   - Gradient-friendly architecture

### Optimization Objectives

The model is trained using a combination of objectives:

1. **Classification Loss**:
```math
L_{cls} = -\sum_{i=1}^C y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
```

2. **Regularization**:
```math
L_{reg} = \lambda \sum_{i=1}^G (||a_i||_2^2 + ||b_i||_2^2)
```

Total loss:
```math
L = L_{cls} + \alpha L_{reg}
```

where α is a hyperparameter controlling regularization strength.

## Architecture Overview

The model combines two significant architectural innovations:
1. Vision Transformer (ViT) - From "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" [1]
2. Group Rational Kernel Attention Network (GRKAN) - Based on the KAT (Kernel Attention Transformer) architecture [2]

### Key Components

- **Patch Embedding**: Splits input images into fixed-size patches (16x16) and linearly embeds them
- **Positional Embedding**: Uses 2D positional embeddings for capturing spatial relationships
- **GRKAN Layers**: Implements group-wise rational attention mechanisms
- **Self-Attention**: Standard multi-head self-attention mechanism
- **Classification Head**: Final layer for image classification tasks

## Configuration

The model uses the following default configuration:

```python
class VITConfig:
    n_emb: int = 768         # Hidden size D
    image_size: int = 224    # Input image size
    n_heads: int = 12        # Number of attention heads
    patch_size: int = 16     # Size of image patches
    n_layers: int = 12       # Number of transformer layers
    dropout: float = 0.1     # Dropout rate
